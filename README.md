# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** using **Jenkins** to automate the build and deployment of a Java web application to a remote Apache Tomcat server hosted on AWS EC2.

The pipeline automatically performs the following tasks:

- Pulls source code from GitHub
- Builds the application using Maven
- Generates a WAR file
- Archives the build artifact
- Deploys the application to a remote Tomcat server using SSH
- Verifies deployment
- Cleans the Jenkins workspace

The entire deployment process is fully automated, eliminating manual deployment steps and reducing deployment time.

---

# 🎯 Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Learn Jenkins Declarative Pipelines
- Automate Java application builds
- Implement Continuous Integration
- Implement Continuous Deployment
- Practice secure SSH-based deployments
- Deploy applications to Apache Tomcat
- Gain hands-on DevOps experience using AWS EC2

---

# 🌍 Real World Use Case

In many organizations, developers manually build Java applications and copy WAR files to production servers.

This approach has several disadvantages:

- Human errors
- Time-consuming deployments
- Inconsistent deployments
- No deployment history
- Difficult rollback

Using Jenkins CI/CD solves these problems by automating the entire deployment lifecycle.

# 💡 Best Practices During Execution

- Use SSH keys instead of passwords.
- Keep credentials in Jenkins Credentials Store.
- Do not hardcode secrets in the Jenkinsfile.
- Verify Java and Maven versions before building.
- Archive artifacts for every successful build.
- Clean the workspace after every pipeline execution.
- Monitor Jenkins logs for failed builds.
- Test deployment on a staging server before production.
- Keep your Jenkinsfile under version control.

# 💼 Resume Description

**Project:** CI/CD Pipeline for Java Web Application Deployment using Jenkins and Apache Tomcat

**Description**

Designed and implemented an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate the build and deployment of a Java web application. Integrated GitHub for source control, Maven for build automation, SSH for secure deployment, and Apache Tomcat on AWS EC2 for application hosting. Automated artifact generation, deployment verification, and workspace cleanup to reduce manual effort and improve deployment reliability.

# ❓ Interview Questions

## Q1. Why did you use Jenkins?

**Answer**

Jenkins automates the software delivery process by integrating source code management, build automation, testing, artifact management, and deployment into a single pipeline.

---

## Q2. Why Maven?

**Answer**

Maven automates dependency management and project builds while providing a standardized project structure.

---

## Q3. Why deploy using SSH?

**Answer**

SSH provides secure communication between Jenkins and the remote application server, allowing automated deployments without exposing sensitive credentials.

---

## Q4. Why archive artifacts?

**Answer**

Artifact archiving stores generated WAR files for future reference, auditing, rollback, and download.

---

## Q5. Why verify deployment?

**Answer**

Verification confirms that the application has been successfully copied to the target server and helps detect deployment issues early.

---

## Q6. What happens if deployment fails?

**Answer**

The pipeline stops, marks the build as failed, displays error logs in the Jenkins console, and skips subsequent stages.

---

## Q7. What improvements would you make?

**Answer**

I would integrate SonarQube, Docker, Kubernetes, Nexus, Prometheus, Grafana, Slack notifications, and implement Blue-Green deployments for production environments.
